## Pendulum
The paper produces the following image, where the angle of the pendulum and the torque are plotted against time.

Our first reproduction yielded the following results:

Once we removed the L-BFGS optimizer and allowed the Adam optimizer to run for a longer amount of iteration, the model converged after approximately 11,000 iterations.
